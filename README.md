# NeoPixel_Layered
Allows the combination of layered effects on your NeoPixel LED array and Arduino compatible controller. Many of the concepts and some of the code for this project was inspired by and pulled from this tutuorial on Adafruit: https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-3/overview.


Please note that this project has not been updated in a very long time and is not actively being developed. I liked some of the concepts and may revisit the project at some point in the future, but I have recently found that working with CircuitPython in the microcontroller environment is much more to my liking and would probably port the concepts to that environment, if I do revisit.
