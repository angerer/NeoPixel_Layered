# NeoPixel_Layered
Allows the combination of layered effects on your NeoPixel LED array and Arduino compatible controller. Many of the concepts and some of the code for this project was inspired by and pulled from this tutuorial on Adafruit: https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-3/overview.


Please note that this project is in early and active development. I will update this description when it is a little more baked.
